    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

    <p>
      A. In SD-WAN, a zone can group different types of interfaces, including both physical (e.g., Ethernet) and logical (e.g., VLAN or VPN) interfaces. This flexibility allows for better traffic management and distribution across various types of network paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      B. SD-WAN zones are often used in static routing to define routes where traffic should be directed. This is helpful for steering traffic based on business needs and the performance of specific WAN paths, enhancing control over routing policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      E. An SD-WAN zone is indeed a logical construct that groups multiple interfaces or "members" together. This grouping helps in managing traffic flows by defining specific policies for grouped interfaces in an SD-WAN deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. This statement is incorrect because FortiGate devices support multiple SD-WAN zones, not just three. The exact number of zones may vary based on the device model and firmware, but it’s generally more than three.
    </p>
    <p>
      D. This statement is also incorrect because an SD-WAN zone can contain just one member. While it's common to have multiple members to benefit from SD-WAN features like load balancing, it’s not a strict requirement.
