    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <img src="https://github.com/pc-aide/FCP-SO/blob/main/edu/PreExam/AD/Q4/img/q3.png?raw=true">
    <p>
      B: Flow-based inspection is typically faster and has lower latency because it scans traffic as it flows through, rather than buffering and inspecting the entire file as in proxy-based inspection.<br>
      C: In flow-based inspection, FortiGate can start sending parts of the file to the client while continuing to scan, which helps to reduce latency.
    </p>
    <p>Incorrect:</p>
    <p>D. If a virus is detected, the last packet is delivered to the client.<br/> "When a virus is detected on a TCP session where some packets have been already forwarded to the receiver, FortiGate resets the connection and does not send the last piece of the file. Although the receiver got most of the file content, the file has been truncated and therefore, canâ€™t be opened.</p>
