    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>B is crucial. FortiGate needs to know how to reach networks connected to its interfaces. Directly connected routes ensure that traffic destined for the LAN or DMZ can be forwarded correctly.</p>
    <p>D is also important. Each interface in NAT mode must have an IP address assigned for it to communicate effectively on its respective network (LAN or DMZ).</p>
