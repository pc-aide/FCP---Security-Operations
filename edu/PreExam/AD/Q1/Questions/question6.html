  <p>Two PCs, PC1 and PC2, are connected behind FortiGate and can access the internet successfully. However, when the administrator adds a third PC to the network (PC3), the PC cannot connect to the internet. Based on the information shown in the exhibit, which two configuration options can the administrator use to fix the connectivity issue for PC3? (Choose two.)</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>B. In the IP pool configuration, set the ending IP to 192.2.0.12: The current IP pool range is 192.2.0.10-192.2.0.11, which only provides two IP addresses for network address translation (NAT). To allow PC3 to access the internet, the IP pool should be expanded to include an additional IP address by changing the end of the range to 192.2.0.12.</p>
    <p>D. In the IP pool configuration, set type to overload: Instead of using a one-to-one NAT, changing the type to overload will allow multiple internal addresses (such as PC1, PC2, and PC3) to share a single external IP address. This will solve the issue without needing additional public IP addresses.</p>
    <p>The other options are not suitable:</p>
    <p>A. In the firewall policy configuration, add 10.0.1.3 as an address object in the source field: This option is unnecessary since the firewall policy already allows all addresses from the source (LAN port3).</p>
    <p>C. Configure another firewall policy that matches only the address of PC3 as the source, and then place the policy on top of the list: This option is redundant and would not resolve the underlying issue with the IP pool configuration.</p>
