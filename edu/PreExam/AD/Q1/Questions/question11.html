    <p>It says "if there are only a few calls originating or incoming?" and additionally the name of the filter is "excessive bandwidth</p>
    <p>IN this case we only need to take into account the position of the filter, the application, and the action. Fortigate will analyze the filter from top to bottom like a regular firewall policy. Therefore we have position, then facetime and then action block the final result will be "Block face time"</p>

      "Then, FortiGate scans packets for matches, in this order, for the application control profile:<br/>
      1. Application and filter overrides: If you have configured any application overrides or filter overrides, the application control profile considers those first. It looks for a matching override starting at the top of the list, like firewall policies.<br/>2. Categories: Finally, the application control profile applies the action that youâ€™ve configured for applications in your selected categories.
