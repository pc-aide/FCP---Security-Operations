  </p>
  <p>A network administrator is troubleshooting an IPsec tunnel between two FortiGate devices. The administrator has determined that phase 1 failed to come up. The administrator has also re-entered the pre-shared key on both FortiGate devices to make sure they match. Based on the phase 1 configuration and the diagram shown in the exhibit, which two configuration changes can the administrator make to bring phase 1 up? (Choose two.)</p>

    <p>In IKEv1, there are two possible modes in which the IKE SA negotiation can take place: mail and aggressive mode. The settings on both ends must agree; otherwise, phase 1 negotiation fails and both IPsec peers are not able to establish a secure channel</p>
    <p>Settings on both ends must agree; otherwise, phase 1 negotiation fails and both IPsec peers are not able to establish a secure channel.</p>
    <p>B. On Remote-FortiGate, set port2 as Interface: The diagram indicates that port2 is currently not selected under ‘Interface’ for Remote-FortiGate. Aligning this setting with HQ-FortiGate, which has port1 set as Interface, might resolve inconsistencies.</p>
    <p>D. On HQ-FortiGate, set IKE mode to Main (ID protection): The current setting on HQ-FortiGate is Aggressive for IKE mode, while Remote-FortiGate is set to Main mode. Matching these settings may help in establishing phase 1 of the IPsec tunnel.</p>
