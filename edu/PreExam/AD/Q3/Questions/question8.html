    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>Flow-based inspection mode (A): FortiGate performs antivirus scanning while simultaneously forwarding data to the client, resulting in lower latency. The file is buffered as itâ€™s scanned, allowing transmission to continue, unless a threat is detected.</p>
    <p>Proxy-based inspection mode (D): This mode buffers the entire file before forwarding, which provides a deeper scan but may introduce higher latency. If the file is clean, it is then sent to the client.<br/><br/> Option B and C are incorrect because, in both modes, files larger than the buffer limit might not be fully scanned if they exceed buffer limitations.</p>

      <strong>Correct Answers:</strong><br>
      A. In flow-based inspection mode, FortiGate buffers the file, but also simultaneously transmits it to the client.<br>
      D. In proxy-based inspection mode antivirus scanning buffers the whole file for scanning, before sending it to the client.
